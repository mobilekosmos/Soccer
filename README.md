# Soccer
Next generation Soccer Android App

Small Android App showcasing the use of Kotlin, Retrofit2 (with disk caching) consuming a REST API (mocked with mockapi.io), different Jetpack components, MVVM, LiveData, DataBinding, Moshi, Kotlin Coroutines, SafeArgs, shared transition, image loading with Coil, Kotlin extension function, Kotlin Flow and SharedFlow, Dagger Hilt, etc. Cache provided by Retrofit and Coil, so no Room needed.
- Data and presentation layer, no domain layer for now.
- No Jetpack compose for now.
- Gradle KTS version in separate branch.

All written by me to simply demo my knowledge.
